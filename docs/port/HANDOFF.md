# Port hand-off (branch `port`, worktree `~/conker-wt/port`)

Read `docs/port/PLAN.md` first: the phases, the browser-first target (wasm32/Emscripten) and the
risks. The decomp rules in `tools/eu_port/AGENT_BRIEF.md` and `HANDOFF.md` still apply: worktree
env, `verify_all.sh` before every commit, background jobs, the commit trailer.

```sh
cd ~/conker-wt/port && eval "$(tools/eu_port/wt.sh env port)"   # CONKER_ROOT, CONKERDEV=conkerdev-port
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin
docker exec conkerdev-port python3 -c 'import unicorn'            # if missing: pip3 install --break-system-packages unicorn
```

## State (session P7, 2026-10-22). Details: `docs/port/sessions/P7.md`

- The default build is byte-identical (full `verify_all.sh` OK, 3992/5913). `NON_MATCHING=1` links. protocheck: 0 problems.
- **151 NON_MATCHING bodies.** C coverage including NON_MATCHING is **4143/5913 (70.1%)**, bytes 31.0%:
  init 468/538, game 3639/5332, debugger 36/43. There are 1770 asm-only functions.
- **Guard:** every tools/port script exits 3 unless `CONKER_ROOT` is set, equals the script's checkout, and equals the cwd's git
  toplevel (`tools/port/portguard.{py,sh}`). The `eval "$(tools/eu_port/wt.sh env port)"` is now enforced.
- New bodies:
  - `func_100049E0` (scheduler thread) is **UNVERIFIED-difftest, needs runtime check**. It is an infinite loop, so
    difftest can only return UNSURE. No difference was seen in 10 trials.
  - `func_10003C6C` (allocator) is EQUIV for valid `arg2` (0–4). It needs a runtime check.
  - `func_1502AC88` (ROM record MRU cache) is EQUIV, but only the miss path was exercised.
- difftest: trailing-padding fix (a matched `--self` false DIFFER), libultra/reference-only arity, and opt-in
  `DIFFTEST_OUTPARAMS=1` (stubs write through stack out-params). There is an open Unicorn mis-run on IDO jump tables in long
  loops, plus random segfaults (exit 139). See P7.md.

## Next steps (from P7)

1. Browser-critical, still asm: **func_1501BBB8** (controller pad read per frame: OSContPad[4] at sp38, b_boot2 draft
   has one CERR `sp.u38 = 0`) and **func_1501878C** (412 insns, no draft).
   Then P8's list: **func_1510D66C** (texture cache), **func_1510D3E0** (patches texture-id 0xFD commands in model DLs),
   **func_1510D984** (per-frame cache ageing), **func_150159E8** (95 calls per 10 s of boot).
   Do not convert `func_100061F8`/`func_150ADA20`: the browser branch has PC overrides for them.
2. The re-run `RERUN_PREFIX=r7 tools/port/rerun_p5.sh p2A p2B b_rest_00 b_rest_01 b_rest_02 b_rest_03 b_boot2` was started in the
   background in P7 (log `port_work/r7_all.log`, results `port_work/r7_<tag>/`). It is slow: p2A alone took about 40 min. If it was
   killed, restart it for the unfinished tags. p2A gave 3 lint-clean EQUIVs that are **not inserted yet**: `func_150416EC`,
   `func_1507DFE4`, `func_15007440` (`port_work/r7_p2A/pass/`). Insert them with `insert_nm.py`, then run protocheck and verify_all.
3. Consider making `DIFFTEST_OUTPARAMS=1` the default (run selftest first). Also re-check the earlier EQUIVs whose code depends on out-params.

## State (session P5, 2026-10-22). Details: `docs/port/sessions/P5.md`

- The default build is byte-identical (full `verify_all.sh` OK, 3992/5913). `make VERSION=eu NON_MATCHING=1` links.
- **148 NON_MATCHING bodies** (P2: 127). C coverage including NON_MATCHING is **4140/5913 (70.0%)**, bytes 30.9%:
  init 466/538, game 3638/5332, debugger 36/43. There are 1773 asm-only functions (198 under 60 insns). The boot path (`boot_depth3.txt`) has 84 asm-only left.
- **difftest needs Unicorn 2.0.1** (2.1.x mis-runs calls whose delay slot is an FPU instruction). Install it once per worktree:
  `docker exec $CONKERDEV pip3 install --target /conker/port_work/pyuc201 unicorn==2.0.1.post1`. difftest picks it up automatically.
  Stubs are now real `jr ra` code, ld/sd/daddiu are emulated, and an overlapping candidate runs at an alternate base. selftest passes 20/20.
- protocheck reads files as the NON_MATCHING build sees them and reports 0 problems. The convention for a matching-code prototype that disagrees with a body:
  wrap it in `#ifdef NON_MATCHING <body's signature> #else <old> #endif`. Inside an NM body, change it directly; never nest.
- **ALWAYS** `eval "$(tools/eu_port/wt.sh env port)"` in the same shell call as insert_nm.py / protocheck.py / progress_nm.py
  (they default to ~/conker). P5 wrote 17 bodies into ~/conker by mistake. That still needs a user revert (see P5.md "Incident").

## Next steps (from P5)

1. Finish the re-run: `tools/port/rerun_p5.sh b_boot2 p2A p2B b_rest_00 b_rest_01 b_rest_02 b_rest_03` (background, about 1 h).
   Insert the lint-clean EQUIVs, then run protocheck and verify_all.
2. P4 priority list (`~/conker-wt/web/docs/port/sessions/P4.md`). Done: 10005BE0, 10001420, 15015FBC, 15003570, 15006234,
   150158D0, 15172C50, 10004074. **Open, in order:** 1501878C (412 insns), 1501BBB8 (278), 1502AC88 (159), **10003C6C
   (allocator, 258; returns 0 in wasm)**, 15085710, 100052A0, 10005B04 (56), 100049E0, 10008180, 15043384, 1509BA04,
   150A00F0 (43), 15007B3C, then 1515DC40, 151674F8, 151412BC, 151E5928, 1510BA9C, 15019130/19464/195A0/19CC8.
   PC replacements needed: `func_100061F8` (TLB writes, no-op), `func_150ADA20` (guRandom, u64 C given in P5.md).
3. difftest gaps: callee out-params are never written (code behind `if (*out)` is untested). Doubleword ALU ops are not emulated.
   Random function-pointer tables are slow (`func_15013000`; a draft in `port_work/p5/`).
4. Earlier items: P2 steps 3–4 below (near-miss fan-out, NODRAFT hand drafts).

## State (session P2, 2026-10-21) — read `docs/port/sessions/P2.md` for details

- The default build is byte-identical: full `verify_all.sh` OK, 3992/5913 matched (unchanged).
- **127 NON_MATCHING bodies** (P1: 9). C coverage including NON_MATCHING: **4119/5913 (69.7%)**;
  init 461/538, game 3622/5332, debugger 36/43; 1794 asm-only (208 under 60 insns).
  Run `python3 tools/port/progress_nm.py` (after verify_all regenerates `conker/progress.csv`).
- Pass rates with the P2 pipeline: pilot A 13/30 (43%, was 30%), pilot B 7/30 (23%, was 10%);
  batch: boot path 22/121, small (<60 insns) 86/261 (33%).
- `make VERSION=eu NON_MATCHING=1` links again (NM-only `.nm_rodata` NOLOAD section for C literals).
- New tools: `tools/port/{cfix.py, nmrepair.sh, nmrepair.py, progress_nm.py, protocheck.py}`.
  convert.py has the new fix chain (spframe, u8arith, cmp2, deref, rostr, passthru2, proto);
  difftest learns pointer inputs when the reference faults, and `-v` explains a DIFFER.
- **One prototype per function (P3/wasm):** run `python3 tools/port/protocheck.py` before every
  commit that inserts bodies. convert.py flags `lint:proto` and repairs it with `cfix.fix_proto`. Open:
  `func_150AD9A0` (callers disagree: 3 vs 4 args), `func_150A2280`; `func_10004074`/`func_10007D14`
  not inserted (void vs s32 callers in matching code).

## Next steps (from P2)

1. difftest: the Unicorn `UC_ERR_EXCEPTION at 0x00000000` after a stubbed call returning into a branch
   (UNSURE `func_150B0574`, `func_151DAE28`; many `fault only in cand` DIFFERs). This is likely a false
   negative and the biggest single win. Also `sd`/`ld` (MIPS III) need UC_MODE_MIPS64 or emulating them in a hook.
2. Boot path for P3: 99 boot asm-only functions remain (list `tools/port/pilot/boot_depth3.txt`, BFS depth 3 from `func_15007830`, see
   P2.md). Hand repair with `tools/port/nmrepair.sh f` from `port_work/b_boot2/best/`; re-run
   `func_150158D0`, `func_15084E80`.
3. Fan-out hand repair of the batch near misses (`port_work/b_*/results.tsv`: 96 DIFFER, 68 CERR).
   86 NODRAFT need hand drafts (gen2 rejects the m2c output).
4. Caller-side prototype fixes for NON_MATCHING (wrap conflicting prototypes in matching files in
   `#ifdef NON_MATCHING`), coordinated with P3's list of 262 mismatched calls.

## P1 notes (still valid)

## State (session P1, 2026-10-21)

- The default build is byte-identical: full `verify_all.sh` OK, 3992/5913 matched functions (unchanged).
- NON_MATCHING bodies so far: 9 functions (the pilot EQUIVs). List them with
  `grep -c '^#ifdef NON_MATCHING$' -r conker/src_eu`.
- Tools added: `tools/port/{difftest.sh, difftest/difftest.py, difftest/selftest.sh, convert.py, insert_nm.py, nm_layout.py}`.
  The Makefile now has `NON_MATCHING=1`.

## Convention

```c
#ifdef NON_MATCHING
s32 func_150FB708(u8 *arg0) { ... }        /* functionally equivalent C (difftest EQUIV) */
#else
#pragma GLOBAL_ASM("asm/nonmatchings/game_eu_127840/func_150FB708.s")
#endif
```

- `//HOIST` declarations go into one `#ifdef NON_MATCHING // hoisted ...` block after the last
  `#include`. `//DROP` lines are wrapped in `#ifndef NON_MATCHING`. Both only take effect in
  NON_MATCHING mode, so they can never change the matching build.
- `make -C conker VERSION=eu NON_MATCHING=1 -j8` (inside the container) adds `-DNON_MATCHING`,
  builds into `conker/build_nm/` (the ld script is rewritten with sed `build/` → `build_nm/`) and
  skips the sha1 verify. The matching `build/` is not touched.

## difftest (`tools/port/difftest.sh FUNC [draft.c] [--self] [--trials N] [-v] [--json]`)

- Reference: the words of `asm/nonmatchings/.../FUNC.s`, or `conker.eu.bin` at the function's EU
  address for C functions with `--self`.
- Candidate: the draft compiled by IDO with the file's exact flags, in a standalone TU built like
  `m2c/screen.py` (other pragmas dropped, other NON_MATCHING blocks resolved to C). It is relocated so
  every symbol gets its EU address from the symbol files, and the TU's `.rodata/.data/.bss` go to 0x80700000.
- Unicorn MIPS32 BE. Memory pages are created lazily with deterministic pseudo-random words: zero,
  small ints, packed small halfwords/bytes, heap pointers (0x80400000–0x80600000), floats
  (including 0/±1/0.5/2/100), noise. Code and rodata are mapped from the ROM image. Odd trials also
  use the ROM's initial `.data`; even trials use random globals.
- Arguments follow the candidate's parameter types (pointer → heap, int → small/-1/16-bit/noise,
  float/double → f12/f14 under the o32 rules) plus 12 random stack-arg words.
- Callees outside the function body are stubs. Each logs (address, a0–a3 up to the arity, stack args
  in the contiguous run from sp+0x10, f12–f15 if set, and a hash of the non-stack memory written so far).
  It returns deterministic random v0/v1/f0/f2 and clobbers the caller-saved registers. Arity comes
  from the TU prototype, or else from which a-registers the call site writes (`call_site_writes`).
- Compared: the call trace, memory at each call, the final memory writes outside the stack, the
  return value (from the candidate's declared return type), and sp, s0–s8, f20–f30. Pointers into
  the stack compare equal. A candidate TU-local object (a string or table literal) compares equal
  to the reference address if the first 32 bytes match.
- Verdicts:
  - `EQUIV`: no difference, and at least `max(4, trials/8)` trials ran to completion.
  - `DIFFER <reason>`: the first difference.
  - `UNSURE`: too many trials ended in a fault or timeout. A fault in the reference only makes the trial
    inconclusive (the input was invalid). A fault in the candidate only is DIFFER.
  - `CERR`: compile error, with the offending lines after `@@`.
  - `ERROR`: setup problem.
- Speed: about 0.3–2 s per function at 64 trials. `DIFFTEST_BUDGET` (30 s) caps the time per check.
- `tools/port/difftest/selftest.sh`: 5 matched functions → EQUIV, 7 mutants → DIFFER, and one mutant
  that is semantically equivalent (`>` → `>=` where both branches give 0) → EQUIV. All 13 pass.

**Limits (read before trusting an EQUIV):**
- **Pointers passed to callees are not dereferenced.** A stub never reads or writes through its
  arguments. So `&sp1C` with scalar neighbours `sp20, sp24...` (an m2c vector split into scalars) passes
  if IDO happens to keep the layout, but it is wrong for clang/wasm. convert.py flags this as
  `lint:stackaddr`. Fix those drafts with `tools/eu_port/vecfix.py` / `spstruct.py` (make it an array
  or struct) before they go to Phase 3.
- Out-params: callee writes are not modelled, so code that reads a value back from a callee-filled
  buffer sees zeros/random in both runs and is only compared for consistency.
- FP: results are compared bit-exactly, and the operands are random. NaN payloads and exact rounding
  corner cases are covered only by chance. Reassociated FP expressions report DIFFER, which is
  correct.
- Big loops / large memory: capped at 100k instructions per run (`--max-insns`). Loops that are
  bounded by random data time out in both runs (inconclusive). The coverage of long paths is poor.
- TLB addresses 0x15xxxxxx/0x16xxxxxx: kuseg is mapped identity (no TLB). Code that computes code
  addresses or reads its own code works on the ROM image, but self-modifying or DMA'd code is not
  modelled. kseg2 (0xC0000000+) accesses fault (inconclusive).
- rand / time: callees such as `rand` are stubs with deterministic returns. That is fine as long as
  both versions call them the same number of times in the same order.
- Indirect calls through random function pointers land in stubs keyed by the random address.
  They are consistent, but nothing checks that the pointer came from the right table entry beyond
  the address itself.
- Hardware access (`0xA4xxxxxx`) is random RAM: no side effects are modelled.
- Callee arity is inferred. A wrong K&R/implicit prototype in the TU plus an a-register that the
  candidate does not write can hide a missing argument when the reference doesn't write it either
  (a pass-through), but then the values are equal anyway.

## convert.py (`tools/port/convert.py --tag T (-l list | FUNC...) [--insert] [--no-gen] [--trials N] [--jobs J]`)

1. gen2.py (`JT=1 LAX=1`) with typed contexts (`TYPED=1` → `gen/v0..7`) and untyped ones (`gen/u0..7`),
   `narrow.py` variants (`nv*`, `nu*`), and `argfix.py --tail` variants (`av*`, `au*`). That is up to
   48 drafts per function. Typed needs `python3 tools/eu_port/fieldinfer.py --report` once per worktree
   (already done here).
2. In the container, with 8 processes: each distinct draft goes through difftest. On CERR, autofixes
   run in a chain: `implproto` (hoist the prototype of a function that is used before its prototyped
   definition), `cmpcast`, `fnptr` (fnptrfix.py), `redecl`, `qtypes`, `undecl`, `argc`. On DIFFER the
   `passthru` fix runs: when the callee needs `aN` that m2c dropped, the caller's own `argN` is inserted.
   Up to 6 rounds per draft and `CONVERT_BUDGET` (150 s) per function.
3. Output in `port_work/T/` (gitignored): `results.tsv` (func, verdict, variant, fixes+lints, reason),
   `attempts.tsv` (every attempt), `pass/<f>.c`. With `--insert`, the EQUIV ones are inserted.
   Re-run `verify_all.sh` afterwards.

## Pilot results

Two pilots, chosen at random with a fixed seed, one function per file (`tools/port/pilot/pilot30*.txt`;
results in `tools/port/pilot/pilot30*_results.tsv`):

| pilot | size (insns) | EQUIV | DIFFER | CERR | NODRAFT | UNSURE | HANG |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A `pilot30` | 8–80 | **9 (30%)** | 9 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| B `pilot30b` | 81–200 | **3 (10%)** | 11 | 11 | 2 | 3 | 0 |

- Of the 12 EQUIVs, 4 are flagged `lint:stackaddr` (`&spXX` of a scalar local passed to a callee).
  They are fine on IDO but must become arrays or structs before the wasm build.
- The 9 pilot-A EQUIVs are inserted as NON_MATCHING bodies; verify_all is OK. The pilot-B EQUIVs
  (`func_15060BE0`, `func_150BE7E8`, `func_151BCD44`) are in `port_work/pilot30b/pass/` but not
  inserted yet.
- About 20 s per function of wall time (8 workers), dominated by the m2c generation and the up to 48 drafts.

Failure reasons, both pilots (60 functions):

| count | reason | what it means / next fix |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | DIFFER: wrong call argument | m2c arity/pass-through mistakes, typed `struct127 *` pointer arithmetic scaling byte offsets (`p += 0x32C`), `""` emitted for an unnamed rodata symbol, float args in GPRs. The `passthru` autofix sometimes fixes them; sometimes it inserts the wrong param (an `&local` was expected). |
| 5 | CERR `'spXX' undefined` | m2c stack locals it could not type. Autofix idea: declare `u8 spXX[N]` sized from the frame. |
| 5 | NODRAFT | gen2 rejects m2c output (M2C_ERROR etc.); needs a hand draft |
| 4 | DIFFER call count | control flow mis-decompiled (conditions, loop exits) |
| 4 | UNSURE | every trial faults in the reference: these functions need valid pointer graphs (nested struct pointers). Idea: a per-function "input template" option in difftest. |
| 3+3+1+1 | CERR operand type errors (`==` pointer vs int, deref of non-pointer, `&` on non-lvalue, non-lvalue) | typing errors in drafts. `cmpcast` handles only simple cases; an expression-level retyping pass (everything `s32`/`u8 *`) would help. |
| 3 | DIFFER memory state before a call | a missing or extra store |
| 2 | CERR redeclaration | conflicting prototypes in the headers vs the draft |
| 2 | DIFFER timeout/fault only in cand | loops that never end (wrong loop variable) or extra loads |
| 1 each | fn-pointer tables, sinf argument, unaligned-fault mismatch, syntax error, missing array size, hang | |

**Planning consequence:** expect about 20–30% automatic conversion on small functions and about 10% on
mid-size ones. The remaining ~1890 functions are 75% above 50 instructions. So Phase 1 is mostly
**hand repair against difftest**, with convert.py as the first pass that also gives each
function a ready reason (`attempts.tsv`).

### Hand-repair loop (what fan-out sessions do)

1. `python3 tools/port/convert.py --tag <range> -l <list>` (in the background) for a file range.
   Use `pilot/all_asm.tsv` for name/size/file.
2. `--insert` (or `insert_nm.py f port_work/<tag>/pass/f.c`) for the EQUIVs. Then run `verify_all.sh`
   and commit.
3. For each failure: read the best draft (`port_work/<tag>/gen/<variant>/f.c`, plus the fixes listed
   in `attempts.tsv`), the asm (`tools/eu_port/sh.sh f`) and the difftest reason. Edit, then run
   `tools/port/difftest.sh f draft.c -v` until EQUIV. Use a struct/array for any stack object whose
   address is taken (no `lint:stackaddr`). Code quality matters more than matching: this C becomes
   the PC source.
4. Matching is not required: drop permuter-style tricks; prefer readable, typed code.


## NON_MATCHING build: status and blockers

- `make VERSION=eu NON_MATCHING=1` **compiles and links** with the 9 bodies (`build_nm/conker.eu.elf`).
- `tools/port/nm_layout.py` (container, from `conker/`) compares the two ELFs. With the 9 bodies
  `.game` is 16 bytes smaller, and **2771 functions moved** (the first is `func_150851E0`, +20). The data
  did not move this time; it will once C rodata sizes differ.
- Blockers for a ROM that boots:
  1. **The data is not shiftable.** The game/init data are incbin'd blobs (`assets/*.databin.bin`,
     `*.rodatabin.bin`). They hold raw addresses of functions, jump-table targets of every GLOBAL_ASM
     function, and data pointers. The 9,557 `D_` symbols are absolute linker assignments. Any move
     breaks them. Fix: PLAN Phase 2A (trampolines, address-stable) or 2B (symbolize the data).
  2. **rzip packing** (`build_nm/conker.eu.game.rzip.bin`): `compress_dir.py` needs the bundled
     x86 `tools/gzip`, which fails in the arm64 container (`ERROR calling gzip`, then a NameError in
     the script). Run it in the x86 image `conker` (as `verify_all.sh` does). `TEXT_SECTION_LENGTH`,
     `DATA_SECTION_LENGTH` and the code padding are fixed in the Makefile and must be recomputed if
     the code grows.
  3. `make replace` copies the built segments into `../assets/` (shared with the matching build).
     A NON_MATCHING ROM needs its own outer build target (e.g. `assets_nm/`). This has not been written.

## Next steps

1. **P2: conversion throughput (one session).** Improve convert.py on the measured failure
   classes before fanning out:
   - an `'spXX' undefined` autofix;
   - an expression-level type relaxation for the CERR operand errors;
   - stop TYPED drafts scaling byte offsets (`struct127 *` + const), or fall back to untyped;
   - an m2c `""`-string fix (pass the rodata symbol names);
   - a smarter `passthru` (prefer an `&local` when the reference passes a stack address);
   - per-function input templates for the UNSURE class.
   Add `tools/port/nmrepair.sh f` (asm + best draft + difftest -v reason in one view). Re-run both
   pilots to measure, then convert the ~210 functions under 50 insns in batches with
   `--insert` + `verify_all.sh`.
2. **P3 (can run in parallel, different worktree): Phase 3 skeleton.** Add `Dockerfile.emsdk` (emsdk
   in a container, no host installs), a CMake build that compiles the matched C plus the
   NON_MATCHING bodies for wasm32 with libultra stubs (`src/pc/ultra`), and a "hello frame"
   page. This finds the wasm compile errors in the existing C early (IDO-isms, K&R calls,
   `GLOBAL_ASM` leftovers need stubs). Also prototype the ASYNCIFY fiber scheduler for
   `osCreateThread`/`osRecvMesg` (PLAN 3.8), the biggest design risk.
3. Then: fan-out hand-repair sessions over disjoint file ranges (2–3 at a time). In parallel, Phase 2b
   data symbolization (datarefs.py → `.word sym` data files), which unblocks a shiftable
   NON_MATCHING ROM and the wasm data layout.

Known tool issues:
- `func_150416EC` hung a worker before the SIGALRM guard was added (convert.py now records `HANG`).
  It was not re-run.
- Docker Desktop's file sync can lag: a file edited on the host may be seen half-written in the
  container for a second. Wait for the sync to settle before re-running a tool that was just edited.
- Never run two convert.py jobs on the same `--tag`: they share `results.tsv`.


## Browser build (sessions P3, P4, P6, P8, P9; branch `port-web`)

Full notes: `docs/port/sessions/P3.md` (platform skeleton), `docs/port/sessions/P4.md` (memory
model, boot, priority list), `docs/port/sessions/P6.md` (indirect calls, renderer, microcode) and
`docs/port/sessions/P8.md` (address space, PC overrides, texture ids, re-rank) and
`docs/port/sessions/P9.md` (ROM-offset symbols, KSEG0 tests, audio HLE). The memory-model design is in **`docs/port/MEMORY.md`**. Everything is
under `port/`; nothing shared was changed, so the matching build is unaffected.

- **Memory model (P4):** N64 data stays at its N64 offsets in two mirror arrays (`n64_rdram`
  8 MB, `n64_seg16`). Data symbols are labels there (`port/stubs/n64mem_labels.s`).
  `port_mem_load()` copies `init_data`, `game_data` (rzip, inflated) and `debugger_data` from the
  user's ROM and relocates 5354 pointer words: 3244 become wasm function-table entries, 2110 data
  pointers. The pointer list comes from a scan of the blobs with range and function-start rules
  (`port/tools/n64mem.py`). Only 14 zero-filled data stubs remain (ROM offsets used as `&sym`).
- **Endianness (P4): game memory is virtual big-endian.**
  - Storage is word-swapped; byte accesses use `A^3`, halfword accesses `A^2`, 64-bit accesses swap
    halves.
  - `port/tools/vbe.py` applies this to every game TU at the LLVM IR level before optimization.
  - Game C code needs **no** swaps, and mixed-width access works.
  - ROM data and assets need no per-format swappers: DMA is a bswap32 copy.
  - Bitfields and the PC layer's sub-word accesses (`vbe_*` in `port/ultra/pc_mem.h`) are the
    exceptions. See MEMORY.md, "What this implies for the C code".
- **Signatures (P4):** `port/tools/sigs.py` gives every function one wasm signature (definition, or
  majority call site for stubs) and rewrites 791 mismatching call sites. Link signature warnings
  went from 288 to 1. Indirect calls: see P6 below.
- **Endianness test:** `port_memtest` checks real converted functions (`func_1509CE20/40/60/88`,
  `func_15041770`) against BE values decoded from the ROM in Python. 45/45 pass in node and in
  headless Chrome.
- **Boot:**
  - PC `func_15007830` (`port/boot/game_entry.c`) → full init sequence → main loop. The state
    machine is read from the ROM's jump table; one pass per frame.
  - P4: 23 distinct asm stubs were hit (P8: 15, see the priority list below). The top ones per frame were: `func_100061F8`, `func_10001420`,
    `func_10005BE0`, `func_1501878C`, `func_1501BBB8`; during init: `func_1502AC88` (×201) and the
    allocator `func_10003C6C`.
  - Next wave: `func_10004074`, `func_1515DC40`, `func_151674F8`, and the `func_1501878C` callees.
    The full 50-entry list is in P4.md.
- **Scheduler (P3):** libultra threads as emscripten fibers (ASYNCIFY). Priority scheduling, one VI
  retrace per frame, priority-0 idle threads park. `port_wait_frame()` paces PC-written loops.
- **Census (P3):** 7 of 719 TUs fail under clang and are left out (`port/build/census/summary.txt`).
- **Indirect calls (P6):** every indirect call in game code goes through a site-typed
  trampoline (`port/tools/icall.py`). Matching signatures take a plain `call_indirect`. Mismatches
  are converted with o32-like rules through `__port_icall_slow`, so they no longer trap.
  - 5270 functions are registered, with 218 target signatures.
  - The registry check over 5 ROM function tables passes, 654/654.
  - `[icalltest] PASS` in node and in headless Chrome.
  - Design: MEMORY.md, "Indirect calls (session P6)".
- **Renderer (P6):** `port/gfx/` is an F3DEX2 interpreter on WebGL2, written fresh.
  - It covers TMEM, all common texture formats, the two-cycle combiner, and Conker's Rare `TRI4`
    opcodes 0x10–0x1F.
  - `osSpTaskStartGo(M_GFXTASK)` → `gfx_run_task`. This path is ready, but **no task arrives
    yet**: the scheduler `func_100049E0` and the frame builders are asm stubs.
  - Proof: `?app=game&gfxdemo=1` draws six real model display lists inflated from ROM assets.
    Screenshot: `docs/port/sessions/P6_screenshot.png`. Tool: `port/web/shot.sh OUT.png 'app=game&gfxdemo=1'`.
  - The ROM has 8 microcodes: F3DEX / BS / BG / BGBS, each also as .NoN, all "fifo 2.08". The
    data block is 0x6C0 per ucode, and `G_LOAD_UCODE` switches between them per frame. Details in
    P6.md §2.
- **Address space (P8):** the game is linked with `-sGLOBAL_BASE=256MB`, so every wasm data address
  is `>= 0x10000000`. Display-list values `0x01000000..0x0FFFFFFF` are always RSP segment addresses,
  and the renderer needs no heuristic. The cost is virtual only (node maxRSS +8 MB, noise). The
  risk is 32-bit browser processes and an untested iOS device. MEMORY.md, "Address space and RSP
  segments".
- **PC overrides (P8):** `port/boot/pc_overrides.c` defines:
  - `func_100061F8`: a TLB-invalidate loop, a no-op on the PC;
  - `func_150ADA20`: `u64` guRandom (`[overrides] guRandom PASS`).

  Game `.c` files are untouched.
- **Texture ids (P8):** the engine resolves G_SETTIMG ids in place at model load:
  - `func_1510D3E0` (asm) walks the DL;
  - `func_1510D66C` (asm) is the cache;
  - the bank is ROM `0x1A3B40 + sum D_800920D0[0..id)`, rzip files;
  - `0x0040xxxx` / `0x0080xxxx` = the 256- / 16-colour TLUT at the end of the texture.

  The viewer has a PC copy (`tex_patch_dl`) and draws real textures (`P8_screenshot.png`).
- **ROM-offset symbols (P9):** `vbe.py` turns `&D_1A3B40`, `&D_AB2240`, `&D_2D810`, `&D_11AF` into
  constants and declares the four `extern s32 func_X` callbacks as functions (data stubs 14 → 6).
  `[romsym] PASS`: the C `func_1510D8F4(0xED0)` = 0x6F1618, and a DMA from there gives the ROM bytes.
  The boot's C `func_15003570` now builds the right texture size table.
- **KSEG0 tests (P9):** `vbe.py` `k0_checks` rewrites `(p & 0xFF000003) == 0x80000000` and
  `K0_TO_PHYS(p) > 0x800000` (4 sites, all audio) for wasm pointers.
- **Audio (P9):** `port/audio/` holds:
  - an n_audio ABI interpreter (Conker/MP3 table, all commands but MP3);
  - SDL output (Emscripten's built-in SDL audio; SDL2 needs an image change);
  - M_AUDTASK / `osAiSetNextBuffer` hooks.

  Test path `aud_test.c`: the game's C `n_alInit`/`n_alSynNew`/`n_alAudioFrame` with a sound from
  the ROM bank. The WAV is exactly the independently decoded sample (correlation 1.0000). The sound
  bank layout (asset table walk, ctl, on-demand records, sample table) is in P9.md. No game audio
  task yet: audio init `func_10008180`/`func_10008F90` and the scheduler are asm.
- **Priority list (P8, after merging port fa5daf8, 10 s boot; full 50 in P8.md):**
  15 distinct stubs are hit.
  - Measured: func_1501878C (540), func_1501BBB8 (540), func_1502AC88 (201), func_150159E8 (95),
    func_10003C6C (13), func_15085710 (3). Once each: func_100052A0, func_1000709C (missing),
    func_10005B04, func_100049E0 (scheduler), func_10008180, func_15043384, func_1509BA04,
    func_150A00F0, func_15007B3C.
  - Next wave: func_1515DC40, func_151674F8, func_151412BC, func_151E5928, func_1510BA9C,
    func_15019130, func_15019464, func_1501A490, func_150195A0, func_15019CC8, func_15084E80,
    func_1510D984 (texture cache), func_15114F9C, func_eu_1501C860, func_1501C55C.
  - Texture path, for a later session: func_1510D66C, func_1510D3E0, func_10004514, func_10006530.
- **Next for the browser build:**
  1. Convert `func_100049E0` and the frame builders (`func_1501878C`, `func_1501BBB8`) on the port
     branch. Game frames then render with no further change.
  2. The texture cache (`func_1510D66C`, `func_1510D3E0`); ROM-offset symbols are done (P9).
     A PC override of the asset-table walker `func_1502AC88` (#3 stub, format in P9.md) unblocks
     the asset loader. Audio: `func_10008180`, `func_10008F90`, `func_10009CBC` as PC overrides, then
     game audio tasks play through `port/audio`. MP3 commands are still missing.
  3. Test the 352 MB memory on 32-bit Android and iOS Safari. Add a `GLOBAL_BASE=16MB` fallback
     only if needed.
  4. Conker lighting (normal array at `G_MOVEMEM` 0x0E); the material DLs in segment 8 for the
     viewer.
  5. Still open from P4.md, "Known gaps":
     - address constants and `K0_TO_PHYS` in C;
     - bitfields;
     - `va_arg` doubles;
     - review of the pointer scan.
